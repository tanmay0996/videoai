For full protection:
✅ Use middleware.ts + withAuth to guard frontend page routes

✅ Use getServerSession() in API routes or server actions to validate the session again

⚠️ Why both? Because users can always bypass frontend restrictions (e.g., via Postman or curl), but can't bypass API route protection.

🧠 TL;DR:
Use withAuth() in middleware to protect frontend routes like /upload, /dashboard, etc.

Use getServerSession() inside API routes like POST /api/videos/upload to prevent unauthorized actions.


# Check with token or session

🧩 How NextAuth Works Internally (Session vs Token)
When using NextAuth, you can configure it to manage sessions in two main modes:

Mode	How It Works
session: "jwt"	✅ Session data is stored in a JWT token (cookie or header)
session: "database"	Session data is stored in a DB, and cookie stores a session ID only




So what’s really happening?

➡️On the client (middleware)
  ✅ You check the token directly (lightweight, fast, runs at edge)
   Token is available immediately via cookies (middleware)	

➡️On the server (API route)
   ✅ You call getServerSession() which internally reads the token and returns the session
   Session is decoded server-side and validated using same token



Both use the same cookie-based token, just accessed differently:

Middleware gets the raw token

getServerSession() decodes it into a full session object
